I don't want you to think i didn't care by the way i reacted (or didn't) this morning, I was still in a hungover haze and I had a lot of things that all hit my mind at the same time when you said we shouldn't be together and it was hard to sift what i really wanted vs what was an emotional reaction.

When we first started dating I thought of it as a fun hookup thing that wouldn't really progress anywhere and I think that has always tainted my view of the relationship and made we think it wasn't going to turn into a serious relationship so not saying I love you seemed like a way to avoid being hurt if things didn't work out but now it's hard to imagine not being with you. 

I had to take some time and really think our relationship over but I do want to be with you and I see us being great together. 

Not saying I love you was just a way of not committing to the relationship because thinking about the next step kind of relationships and life freaks me out - i don't really want to grow up. 

There's nothing about you that makes we not want to be with you or worry about the future
